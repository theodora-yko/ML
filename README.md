# ML

## Background and Documentation:
GraphSage - https://theodorayko.blogspot.com/2022/07/implementation-of-graphsage-using.html

## Usage
1. GNN: 
- contains the definition of neural network models in use   
- class "accuracy" defined: used for training & evaluating a ML model

2. data: downloads datasets in need
3. preliminary analysis: 
- tools in use 

## Roadmap
- [x] preliminary GNN model
- [x] manual_masks
- [ ] implement influence function from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04730.pdf
- [ ] link manual_masks with influence function and improve accuracy
